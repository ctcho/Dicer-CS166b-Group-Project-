  <h2>Rulesets</h2>
  <% if @tutorial %>
  DnD has been around a long time, and people have played with many different versions of the rules.
  Here are the major rulesets. Check whichever ones seem interesting to you.

  <div class="field">

    <h3>
      <%= f.label :original do %>
        Original
        <%= f.check_box :original_ruleset %>
      <% end %>
    </h3>
  <% if @tutorial %>
    The Original ruleset for Dungeons and Dragons has all the fundamentals of the game: a fighting class, a magic class,
    and a healing class, and the roleplaying/dice rolling mechanics. However, the math of
    the game is different than other versions, and it relies somewhat heavily on miniatures. Not recommended for new players!
    <br>

  <h3>
    <%= f.label :advanced do %>
      Advanced
      <%= f.check_box :advanced_ruleset %>
    <% end %>
  </h3>
  <% if @tutorial %>
    Advanced Dungeons and Dragons or 2nd Edition DnD added some more classes to the original version and simplified the combat
    rules. Some dice-rolling rules differ compared to other editions, and not many people play this edition.
    <br>
  <%end%>
    <br>
  <h3>
    <%= f.label :third do %>
      3rd Edition
      <%= f.check_box :third %>
    <% end %>
  </h3>
  <% if @tutorial %>
    3rd Edition Dungeons and Dragons introduced many of the core mechanics in modern DnD - actions become (mostly) centered around
    D20 rolls with some bonuses from character traits, and 3rd edition introduced greater customizability for characters. <b>Almost all
    actions of the game become simplified from this edition onwards.</b>
  <% end %>
  <br>
  <h3>
    <%= f.label :three_point_five do %>
      3.5 Edition
      <%= f.check_box :three_point_five %>
    <% end %>
  </h3>
  <% if @tutorial %>
    DnD v3.5 is an update to the 3rd edition, with some minor tweaks to the rules and some additions here and there to what v3 added.
    Most "homebrew" rulesets start with the mechanics of v3.5. <b>Highly recommended!</b>
    <br>
  <% end %>
  <br>
  <h3>
    <%= f.label :pathfinder do %>
      Pathfinder
      <%= f.check_box :pathfinder %>
    <% end %>
  </h3>
  <% if @tutorial %>
    Pathfinder was a game released as sort of an expansion to v3 and v3.5 of Dungeons and Dragons. Sometimes called "v3.75", Pathfinder
    expanded on the rules and mechanics of version 3 with some slight changes to mechanics like skills and spells. Although not
    <i>technically</i> a ruleset of DnD... it's DnD. <b>Recommended!</b>
    <br>
  <%end %>
  <h3>
    <%= f.label :fourth  do%>
      4th Edition
      <%= f.check_box :fourth %>
    <% end %>
  </h3>
  <br>
  <% if @tutorial %>
    The 4th Edition of Dungeons and Dragons introduced some pretty significant changes to DnD mechanics from v3, including giving every
    class powers that they can use in combat. Most of the combat and power usage in this version is simplified greatly with miniatures or
    a site like <a class="outside" href=https://roll20.net/>Roll20</a>, an online tabletop grid/miniature simulator.

      5th Edition
      <%= f.check_box :fifth %>
    <% end %>
  </h3>
  <% if @tutorial %>
    <h3>5th Edition</h3>
    5th edition is the most recent release of Dungeons and Dragons, and it attempts to simplify combat and mechanics from 4th Edition.
    Powers were removed, and the focus is returned to skills. Spell mechanics were also changed to be more similar to that of 3 and 3.5.
    Wizards of the Coast has many resources for new players in 5th edition, like the <a class="outside" href=http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules>
    basic rules for players and DMs available on their website</a> and the <a class="outside" href=http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_starterset>
    Starter Set</a> which includes dice, rulebooks, and pre-made characters. <b>Highly recommended!</b>

  <h3>
    <%= f.label :homebrew do %>
      Homebrew
      <%= f.check_box :homebrew %>
    <% end %>
  </h3>
  <% if @tutorial %>
    Homebrew refers to the various "house" rules that players use. With such a creative game, players and DMs modify rules for optimal
    enjoyment. Homebrew can also be synonymous with original campaigns, monsters, classes, or anything not created by the publishers.
    Choose this for a more flexible game experience, but be warned: while house rules may simplify things, sometimes it may complicate them too!

<h2>Campaign Types</h2>
  <% if @tutorial %>
  There are two main different types of campaign: modular (published/written) campaigns and original campaigns.
  Playing a module means playing a pre-written campaign out of a book. There's lots of these and even pre-defined universes and settings
  for them to fit into, such as the "Forgotten Realms". Just because they're pre-packaged and pre-written doesn't make them any less fun to play!
  An original campaign is one written or adapted by your DM.
  Both are great, though some modules aren't for everyone, and some original campaigns are made for specific audiences. Sometimes
  an original or "homebrew" campaign will also add its own rules and quirks; conversely, modular campaigns are typically by the book
  when it comes to rules.

  <h2>Bio</h2>
  <% if @tutorial %>
  This section is for you to describe yourself as a player. Eventually, after you've played a few sessions, you will write about
  what you like and don't like in a campaign, DM, and fellow adventurers. For now, write what kind of experience you are looking
  for and why you are interested in trying DnD.

  <h2>Location Details</h2>
  <% if @tutorial %>
  Lastly, we want to know if you're willing to play online, and how far you're willing to travel to play in person.
  Online play allows you to play with people from all over the world using the power of the internet and supplementary applications like
  <a class="outside" href=https://roll20.net/>Roll20</a>.
  Playing in person often has a much different dynamic than online play does, as players can roleplay their characters more accurately
  (like actually whispering to each other).
  <b>Remember, saying that you're willing to play online <i>DOES NOT</i> exclude you from in person play, it just changes who can search for you!</b>
